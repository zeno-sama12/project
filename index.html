  <div><h1>Global Warming</h1></div>
<div>
  <h2>Causes</h2>
</div>
  <p>Global warming is a big problem across the world. Our planet the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.</p>
  <p>Its caused when carbon dioxide, Water vapor, Methane, Nitrous oxide and Chlorofluorocarbons comes together and absorbing the heat causing the Earth to be warmer.  </P>
   
  <p>If this continutes the oceans will warm and partially melt glaciers and other ice,increasing sea level.Ocean water also will expand if it warms, contributing further to sea level rises.</p>

  <em><strong><h4>This polar bear is malnourished because of Climate Change and can't find any food</h4></strong></em>
  <div>
    <h3>The fault of humans</h3>
  </div>
   <p>Emissions from cars and power plants with the amount of radiation from the sun that emits is some of the reasons of Global Warming.</p>
   <p>Burning coal, gas and oil in power plants and cars. Also cutting down and Burning forests cause soot that absorb the sunlight and drive temperature rise. </p> 
   <p>It's not just warmer weather,It's major storm surges,floods and snow storm.</p>
    <div>
      <h2>Effects</h2>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Temperatures are expected to continue rising</li>
      <li>Growing season(frost free season) will lengthen</li>
      <li>The changes in precipitation patterns</li>
      <li>More droughts and heat waves</li>
      <li>Hurricsanes will get stronger in intenstiy</li>  
      <li>Sea level will rise 1-4 feet by 2100</li>
      <li>If this keeps up the Arctic would likely become ice-free by mid-centry</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Don't feel hopeless there is some hope.The government has set limits on the amount of mercury, arsenic and other toxic pollutants that power plants are allowed to emit into the air.</p>
    <p>Since 2005, the United States has reduced its total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth,Wind power has tripled, and energy from the sun has increased tenfold.</p>
    <p>The government's plan is to set standards that will reduce carbon pollution by 30% by the year 2030.</p>

     </div>
     <ul>
       <li>you can use pulic transit</li>
       <li>go carpooling</li>
       <li>switch to an electric or hybrid vehicle</li>
       <li>uplug computers, tv and other electronics when you're not using them</li>
       <li>Install a programmable thermostat</li>
       <li>Look for the Energy Star label when buying new appliances</li>
     </ul>
